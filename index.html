                    Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge. It enlightens, empowers, and
                    creates a positive development. Education gives an individual the knowledge and skills to work with
                    virtue. It aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and development of an
                    individual.

                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
                learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students.
                Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students
                learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed
                around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices
                include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms),
                student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.

                The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local
                educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary
                purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide
                range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses,
                students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts

                Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements
                such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning
                materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both
                physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that
                should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school
